# A Joycon packet encoding and decoding lib

TBD.

Note that this library does not contain Bluetooth/USB HID implementation, you can use one on a specific platform, e.g. hidapi on Linux/Win, to read/send raw packets, and use this library to extract/encode information from/to the packets.

## Have fun
